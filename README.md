# theTheoryOfEverything
The theory of everything is a short generative video entirely developed in a Processing environment, through about one thousand lines of code. The aim is to visualize, through a sequence of animated images, the most important attempt of contemporary physics: the search for a theory of everything. 

I am the sole owner of the project, which could be embedded into a bigger web project with an introductory or summary role. At the same time, with the same role, it could be used within exhibitions and events dedicated to physics and scientific research.

As regards the contents, the video shows microcosmic (ions, protons and electrons) and macrocosmic (lunar phases, the sun, nebulae, black holes) scenes. This because the theory of everything tries to explain and put together all known microcosmic and macrocosmic physical phenomena.
